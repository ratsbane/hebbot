# Hebbot Lab Notebook

*A running log of experiments, findings, and reasoning for the Hebbot project. Started 2026-06-05 after renaming from `panda-mcp`. Prior 98 findings in the `panda-mcp` lab notebook remain valid as historical reference; new findings continue from #99.*

## 2026-06-05 — Project rename + OMEN setup complete

Hebbot started today as a fresh repo following the [2026-05-28 reset](https://github.com/ratsbane/panda-mcp/blob/main/lab_notebook.md) in the prior `panda-mcp` notebook. The decision to rename came after iterating on the thesis statement to its current form: *use agentic AI to bootstrap a system with continuous learning*. The name **Hebbot** honors Donald Hebb (Hebbian learning) + robot + the *good hebbot / good habit* pun, and is search-clean (no existing tech usage).

### What's working as of today

The new host machine (`omen`, an HP OMEN 16L with RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, Ubuntu 26.04, real-time kernel) is fully operational and connected to the Franka Panda. End-to-end chain verified yesterday:

- OMEN ↔ Linux 26.04 + PREEMPT_RT kernel ↔ NVIDIA driver 595 + CUDA 13.1 ↔ panda-python venv (Python 3.12 via uv) ↔ Ethernet w/ NetworkManager `shared` mode (dnsmasq DHCP) ↔ Franka FCI ↔ libfranka 1 kHz control loop ↔ **physical 7-DOF arm motion**

Full setup details in [`docs/panda-setup.md`](docs/panda-setup.md).

### Findings

| # | Finding |
|---|---------|
| 99 | The Franka's network interface is a **DHCP client**, not a static-IP peer. A Linux host on the direct-Ethernet link must run a DHCP server (NetworkManager `ipv4.method=shared` does this via dnsmasq). Static-IP on both ends fails silently — Franka has no IP and emits no packets. This was the morning's hardest debug; documented end-to-end in `docs/panda-setup.md`. |
| 100 | NVIDIA's open kernel module refuses to build on PREEMPT_RT kernels by default — sanity check at `Kbuild:305: preempt_rt_sanity_check`. Removing the check from the Kbuild and rebuilding via DKMS works; modules need to be signed with the MOK key and enrolled at first boot (Secure Boot kept on). NVIDIA + PREEMPT_RT then coexist on a single kernel. Officially unsupported by NVIDIA; works in practice. |
| 101 | D405 needs `dev.hardware_reset()` from librealsense at the start of every session — USB unplug alone doesn't reset the camera's internal state, and subsequent pipe.start() succeeds but never delivers frames. Calling hardware_reset + 5-second wait before `pipe.start()` solves it. |
| 102 | `panda-python` ships pre-built wheels for Python 3.10–3.12 only as of mid-2026; no wheels for Python 3.13+. Ubuntu 26.04 ships Python 3.14 by default, so the project venv must explicitly use Python 3.12 (uv handles this cleanly with `uv venv --python 3.12`). |

### Open threads

- **pyzed Python bindings fail to open the ZED 2i** on this system, despite C++ `ZED_Explorer` working fine. Same error from Stereolabs's own sample code. Probably a Stereolabs SDK 5.3.1 + Python 3.12 + Ubuntu 26.04 environment issue. Parked for later debug; not blocking robot work.
- **First end-to-end pick attempt** still to do. Wrist-camera-only depth detection works mechanically but the arm at `move_to_start` pose isn't looking at the block area — need a deliberate survey pose, or plug in the D435 scene camera to use the existing perception pipeline.
- The previously-collected ~100 skill episodes on `panda-mcp` are mostly from a single-viewpoint setup; whether to selectively port them or treat as discardable per the environment-diversity finding (#89 in `panda-mcp` notebook) is a near-term decision.

## 2026-06-06 — First running substrate: 6 skills live-verified, MCP boundary up

Built the Hebbot substrate end-to-end today, from foundations doc through working code, live-verified on the Franka. The repo went from "README + foundations" yesterday to a working library with 5 primitives + 1 composed skill today.

### What's running

**Substrate library** (`hebbot.substrate`):
- SQLite store implementing the foundations Appendix-A schema (skills, episodes, frames, states, decisions tables).
- Skill dispatcher with body-type runners. `classical` and `composition` body types implemented; `script`, `trajectory`, `learned_policy`, `vlm_grounded` are stubbed and raise `UnsupportedBodyTypeError` cleanly.
- Episode lifecycle: `start_episode` → run body → `end_episode` with success + outcome. Parent/child linkage via `parent_id` works.

**Primitives** (`hebbot.skills.primitives`, all live-verified):

| Skill | Body | Live accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| `get_state` | classical | reads live joints, EE pose, force, gripper width |
| `move_to_joints` | classical | ~1.2 mrad max error at speed_factor 0.05 |
| `move_to_pose` | classical | uses `ik_full` with closest-joint branch selection (mock-tested; live untested at intricate poses) |
| `open_gripper` | classical | within ~17 μm of target width |
| `close_gripper` | classical | within ~260 μm of full close |

**Composed skill** (`hebbot.skills.composed`):

- `home` — composition of `open_gripper(width=0.08)` + `move_to_joints(HOME_Q, speed_factor=0.1)`. Verified live; SQLite shows correct nesting: one `home` episode (parent_id=NULL) with two child episodes (parent_id=home.id).

**MCP server** (`hebbot.mcp_server`):

- Single MCP server, stdio transport. CLI entry point `hebbot-mcp` (set up via `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]`).
- Dynamically generates one MCP tool per skill row in the store. Tool schema comes from `skills.params_schema`. Adding a skill = inserting a row; no server restart needed for the change to be visible on `tools/list`.
- Verified end-to-end via direct JSON-RPC stdio handshake (`initialize` + `notifications/initialized` + `tools/list` over `ssh omen hebbot-mcp ...`). All 6 skills appear in the tool list.
- `.mcp.json` committed in repo root: spawns the server via SSH so a macbook-side Claude Code session can call substrate skills on omen.

**Tests**: 8/8 passing in mock mode. Covers primitive registration, dispatch, schema validation, composition execution, parent-child nesting, arg_map pass-through, halt-on-failure.

### Findings

| # | Finding |
|---|---------|
| 103 | The classical-body dispatcher pattern — body JSON `{"function": "module.path:function_name"}`, importlib resolution at call time, cached lookup, optional `_context` kwarg auto-detection — is clean and avoids any registration-time imports. Adding a new primitive = write the function + add a `PRIMITIVE_SPECS` entry. No decorators, no globals beyond the cache. |
| 104 | Composition body type as `{"steps": [{"skill": name, "args": {...}, "arg_map": {...}}, ...]}` is enough for the cases tested. `arg_map` (child arg → parent param name) handles the parent → child param propagation; static `args` handles the rest. Halt-on-failure with `completed_steps` + `sub_results` trail gives the orchestrator everything it needs to diagnose mid-composition failures. |
| 105 | SSH-wrapped stdio MCP is a clean pattern for remote substrate: `"command": "ssh", "args": ["omen", "hebbot-mcp", ...]`. SSH provides bidirectional stdio transparently; the MCP client (Claude Code) doesn't need to know the server runs on another machine. No SSE/HTTP needed. |
| 106 | The substrate's hardware-bootstrap path (try to connect, fall back to mock if failed) lets the same code base run on a workstation without a robot — useful for development and CI. Skills check for the relevant context key (`panda`, `gripper`) and return mock data if missing. The episode's `outcome.result._source` field distinguishes ("mock" vs "live"); future retrieval / distillation passes can filter on this. |
| 107 | `parent_id` foreign key on `episodes` (self-referential) cleanly captures the composition tree. One SQL query returns the full episode tree for a top-level call (`WITH RECURSIVE`). Same query also gives the right structure for the planned RAG retrieval: "show me past `home` executions and their sub-step outcomes." |

### Open threads / what's not built yet

- **MCP boundary not yet exercised from Claude Code itself.** Direct JSON-RPC handshake passes, but the loop "Claude reads tool list → decides to invoke → tool returns → Claude interprets" hasn't been run. That's the next session's first task.
- **`script` body type** still stubbed. This is the bridge to "the orchestrator creates new skill records at runtime" — without it, all skills require a code change to add. Probably the highest-leverage next implementation.
- **`trajectory` and `learned_policy` body types** stubbed. These come later as data accumulates.
- **Frame recording** not wired to episodes yet. The `frames` table exists; no perception primitive writes to it. Next-after-script chunk.
- **Perception pipeline** (detection → segmentation → 6-DoF pose → relational state vector, per commitment #11) not built. Foundations doc has the design; no code yet.
- **Decision logging** (`decisions` table from foundations Appendix A) not implemented in the runtime. Every dispatcher call should be logging.
- **pyzed bug** from setup day still parked — not blocking, C++ ZED tools work.

### What this means for next session

The substrate is *real enough* now that the next session can pick up at any of: implementing `script` body type, building the perception primitive set, wiring decision logging, or doing the MCP-from-Claude-Code round trip. Pick whichever has the most leverage.
